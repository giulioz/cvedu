# cvedu

A small React web application to be used to teach principles of Computer Vision, using your webcam, Typescript and a block–based visual editor.

![screenshoot](./screenshoot.png)

Every block represents a **pure function**, that can process data. You can connect the blocks inputs and outputs dragging them. To delete a connection, simply double–click them.
If you select a block, you can **see its output** and **edit the code**, using the included code editor.

You can easily build a line detector, and play the **included game** with a colored joystick.

A video demonstration is below:

**\*NOTE:** This was built as a side project, to be used specifically for a course taught at my university, it may be unstable or incomplete, and it's still in heavy development. I take no responsability for its usage.\*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
